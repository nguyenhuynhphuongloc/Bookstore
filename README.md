# Overview

The Bookstore Website provides the following core functionalities: Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, Payment Processing, Comments, Notifications, and Access Control. 

Product Catalog: Customers can browse and purchase books using an effective search function. Each book includes essential details such as title, price, rating, and description, allowing customers to make informed purchase decisions. 

Shopping Cart: Customers can add products to their cart either from the product listing page or the detailed product page. The cart displays the number of items, the total price, and a summary of each product. Customers can easily remove items, and the system immediately updates the cart. Once ready, customers can proceed to checkout and pay for their selected products.

After logging in, customers are redirected to the homepage, while administrators gain access to the dedicated Admin Dashboard for managing products, orders, and system data. Moreover, buyer and admin can reset password through email if they forgot.
